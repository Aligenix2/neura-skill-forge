STUDENT'S SPEECH TRANSCRIPT:
"${transcription}"

TOPIC ASSIGNED: "${topic}"

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

üîç 1. SPEECH UNDERSTANDING & CONTEXT
- Analyze if the student addressed the given topic
- Determine if the response is complete, incomplete, or irrelevant
- Consider the depth and relevance of content provided

üß† 2. AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION CORRECTION
- Auto-correct obvious speech recognition errors (e.g., "my pinion" ‚Üí "in my opinion")
- Fix minimal grammar issues, add punctuation, and correct obvious misrecognitions
- Preserve the student's original intent, voice, and natural speaking style
- DO NOT rewrite entire phrases or change the core meaning

‚úÖ 3. MARKING SCHEME (10 POINTS TOTAL - 2 POINTS PER CATEGORY)

Score each category from 0-2 points:

A) CLARITY (2 points max)
- 2 points: Speech is clear and easy to understand
- 1 point: Mostly understandable with some unclear moments  
- 0 points: Difficult to understand throughout

B) STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION (2 points max)
- 2 points: Well-organized with logical flow of ideas
- 1 point: Some structure present but could be improved
- 0 points: Lacks clear organization or structure

C) VOCABULARY & EXPRESSION (2 points max)
- 2 points: Uses appropriate and varied vocabulary effectively
- 1 point: Basic vocabulary that conveys the message adequately
- 0 points: Limited vocabulary that hinders communication

D) GRAMMAR & SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION (2 points max)
- 2 points: Generally correct grammar and well-formed sentences
- 1 point: Some grammar issues but meaning remains clear
- 0 points: Frequent errors that affect comprehension

E) RELEVANCE & CONTENT (2 points max)
- 2 points: Directly addresses the topic with relevant content
- 1 point: Somewhat relevant but could be more developed
- 0 points: Off-topic or extremely minimal content

üí¨ 4. BALANCED FEEDBACK TONE
- Use encouraging language: "Nice job with...", "Well expressed when you said...", "I liked how you..."
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions
- Be constructive, not critical
- Maintain a supportive, coach-like tone

üö® 5. EDGE CASE HANDLING
For very short, unclear, or off-topic responses:
- Assign appropriate low scores with clear reasoning
- Gently explain why the speech didn't contain enough analyzable content
- Encourage the student to try again with more detail
- Remain supportive and motivating

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The overall_score MUST equal the sum of all category scores.
