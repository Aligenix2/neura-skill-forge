SPEECH METRICS:
- Word count: ${wordCount || 'Not provided'}
- Duration: ${durationSeconds || 'Not provided'} seconds
- Calculated WPM: ${wordsPerMinute || 'Not calculated'}

PACING ANALYSIS:
- Classify pace: Very Slow (<100 WPM), Slightly Slow (100-120), Ideal (120-160), Slightly Fast (160-180), Very Fast (>180)
- DO NOT show raw WPM to students
- Use encouraging, simple language
- Provide specific tips based on their pace category

TRANSCRIPTION CORRECTION:
- Auto-correct obvious speech recognition errors
- Fix grammar, add punctuation
- Preserve student's voice and meaning
- Do NOT rewrite entire phrases
